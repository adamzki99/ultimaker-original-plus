# UltiMaker Original+
Collection of information regarding my UltiMaker Original+

## History

The printer was purchased in November 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden, for SEK 1000.

Realizing that UltiMaker no longer maintains the Firmware and that the latest release is labeled "DEV," I wanted to find an alternative firmware. 
Klipper came to mind, and after following the official documentation, the printer was up and running.

Currently, I am printing parts and tuning the machine.
